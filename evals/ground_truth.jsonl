{"question": "What are the safety precautions and compliance guidelines for the C8 appliance to ensure electrical safety and proper maintenance?", "truth": "To ensure electrical safety and proper maintenance of the C8 appliance, it is important to connect the device only to the mains voltage as specified on the type plate located on its underside. The C8 should be directly connected to a household socket to avoid overheating risks associated with using multiple sockets or extension cords. Only mild cleaning agents and a soft cloth should be used, avoiding alkaline or alcoholic cleaning agents. Additionally, only fresh, cold, and non-carbonated water should be used in the water tank, and the device should be turned off and unplugged during extended absences. Original care products from JURA should be used exclusively, as non-recommended products may damage the C8. To prevent electric shock, water and electricity should not be brought into contact, and the plug should never be handled with wet hands. The C8 complies with several EU directives, including the Low Voltage Directive (2014/35/EU), Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (2014/30/EU), Energy Directive (2009/125/EG), RoHS Directive (2011/65/EU), and Radio Equipment Directive (2014/53/EU).
